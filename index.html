                  Camino Podolico is a hiking trail that intertwines cultural,
                  historical and religious essence. It is interesting for all
                  segments of the population, Christians of all denominations
                  and non-believers. Pilgrimage became one of the foundations of
                  tourism and played almost the highest role. People walked
                  hundreds or even thousands of kilometers to the shrines,
                  learning new customs, territories and discovering the world.
                  Hiking was in the first place. And it is he who gives the
                  greatest opportunity to see and learn. It will be a rest not
                  for the body, but for the soul for all those who are morally
                  tired of everyday life, of constant problems at work and at
                  home. Our vacation is a unique opportunity to clear your mind,
                  find the right solutions and return to a completely new person
                  It is a 100 or 250-kilometer (at your choice) walking or
                  cycling tour of the picturesque places of Vinnytsia and
                  Khmelnytsky regions. The impressions you get along the way do
                  not compare with any vacation. You will discover Ukraine on
                  the other side, its beauty, nature, architecture and
                  hospitality. Discover yourself as a traveler, test your
                  strength and get incredible adrenaline.

                Are you afraid that you will not master? The way has already
                been overcome by children, and the route passes though sparsely
                populated places, but still there are people. If you wish, you
                can take a short drive. In addition, in Ukraine, unlike in
                Spain, you can set up tents, tie a hammock, light a fire and
                spend the night quietly. Or stay in a hotel or green estate for
                a day to rest if you are tired. <br />
                In each settlement, which are located 15-25 km along the way,
                there are places for accommodation and shops. You choose where
                it is better to spend the night: in a hotel, in a monastery or
                in a green estate. Each of these types of accommodation has its
                own character and special spirit. Of course, it is desirable to
                book places in hotels in advance, but in any case, you will not
                stay on the street, unless you have a tent. Have a good rest!
                Good Camino!
